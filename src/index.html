Now she lives whit me and my family also she eat, play and course sleep so much. One day Haru got pregnant and she had 2 sons and 2 daughters. And that's how now I live surrounded by plump hairballs. ¡I love my cats!

                    <p>Haru is a white, blue eyes kitty, chubby and fluffy. When she was a puppy she slept with me every day. But now Haru is a protective and responsible mother though also likes to play with me and her toys.</p>

                    <a href="picsLeo.html">Leo. <span><small>(SON)</small></span></a>
                    <p>Leo is a cat for whom love is never enough and hates being alone, always wants to someone pet him and if you don't do it he will start to meow until you please him.</p>

                    <a href="picsKuro.html">Kuro. <span><small>(SON)</small></span></a>
                    <p>Kuro is more reserved than Leo, but he is the most playful of all and he likes the caresses so much. I mean, what he loves most about the world is the treats.</p>

                    <p>Shiro is the most affectionate of her brothers,usually she is with me accompanying me, sleeping beside me or on my lap. Curiously looks like her mother when she was little, which is adorable.</p>

                    <a href="picsSayu.html">Sayu. <span><small>(DAUGHTER)</small></span></a>
                    <p>Sayu is the most reserved and calm of all, she rarely meows, but that doesn't take away from her affectionate and playful nature. She loves playing almost as much as Kuro.</p>
